### 1)
**DAG** stands for Directed Acyclic Graph, which does not contain cycles.

### 2)
A simple path is a path in a graph where **all vertices are distinct**, meaning no vertex is visited more than once.

### 3)
 A simple cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, and all other vertices in between are unique. This means the first and last vertices are the only ones that are repeated.

### 4)
Vertex 4 has a degree of 3.

### 5)
Vertex 1 has a degree of 3.
