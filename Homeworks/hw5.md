### 1)

```
INPUT: A array of N integers where N >= 3
OUTPUT: Three largest elements in array A

first = 0
second = 0
third = 0

for i = 0 to N-1:
    if A[i] > first:
        third = second
        second = first
        first = A[i]
    else if A[i] > second:
        third = second
        second = A[i]
    else if A[i] > third:
        third = A[i]

return [first, second, third]
```

### 2)

The average case for a linear search is **n/2**. Assuming the search value is at iteration i, it takes the linear search i iterations to find the search value. Since the average case for the search key is to be at n/2, that means it would take n/2 iterations on average.

### 3)

The average case for a binary search is **log(n)** because it takes logâ‚‚(n) steps to reduce n to 1 by dividing by 2, and we always use these halving operations regardless of the target's position.

### 4)

Linear search has the advantage over binary search in the case of when the array is **unsorted**. The linear search starts at the first element, regardless of the order of the array, while binary search relies on the properties of sorted arrays.

### 5)

**Advantages of Hashtables:**

1. **Fast Access Time**: Provides O(1) average case time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations
2. **Memory Efficient**: Only stores the data that is actually needed, with no requirement for pre-allocated space like arrays
3. **Dynamic Size**: Can grow or shrink based on the amount of data being stored, making them flexible

**Disadvantages of Hashtables:**

1. **Collision Handling**: When two keys hash to the same location, collisions must be handled using methods like chaining or open addressing
2. **No Ordering**: Elements are not stored in any particular order, making it inefficient for operations that require sorted data
3. **Space Overhead**: Additional memory is required for storing the hash table structure and handling collisions

### 6)

**Advantages of Search Trees:**

1. **Ordered Data Structure**: Maintains elements in sorted order, making operations that depend on sorted data efficient
2. **Balanced Performance**: Provides O(log n) time for search, insert, and delete operations
3. **Flexible Size**: Can dynamically grow and shrink as needed

**Disadvantages of Search Trees:**

1. **Balance Maintenance**: Extra overhead required to maintain balance in the tree, which complicates implementation
2. **Space Usage**: Each node requires extra space for pointers to child nodes, making them less memory efficient
3. **Complex Implementation**: Can be difficult to implement
