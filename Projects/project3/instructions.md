Project Overview. 
In this project you need to create the 3 java files that are describe below: 
1. Create a Java class (SimplyLinkedList.java) where you implement a simple
linked list. In your class you need to implement your own methods to do:
    a. Insertion. To add a node or nodes into the linked list.
    b. Deletion. To delete a node.
    c. Searching. To find a certain element.
    d. Traversal. To access each element of the linked list.
2. Create a Java class (DoublyLinkedList.java) where you implement a double
linked list. In your class you need to implement your own methods to do:
a. Insertion. To add a node or nodes into the double linked list.
b.  Deletion. To delete a node. 
c.  Searching. To find a certain element.  
d.  Traversal. To access each element of the linked list (for doubly linked list 
is forward and backward).

3.  Create a Java class (LinkedListTest.java) where you test your simple and double 
linked lists methods. Inside the class you will: 
a.  Let the user insert by a command line argument; N integer elements, the 
user will have the option to insert certain number of integer elements but 
with an option to add more into the list. 
    i.  The options that the user can choose are: 
        1) Insert (Ask number of elements) 
        2) Delete  
          1.First element in the list 
        3. Last element in the list 
        4. By element 
        5) Search  
          1. By element 
        6) Traversal & Print 
        7) Exit 
        8) 
b.  Let the user choose between the options 
a) Insert, b) Delete, c) Search, d) 
Traversal  &  Print  (with  this  format  [1]  <->  [2]  <->  [3])  and perform  the 
instruction on both Single Linked List and Double Linked List. 

c.  Test the difference in your implementation on single linked list vs double 
linked list measuring the time (nanoseconds) that take to search an integer 
element in a single linked list and a double linked list and print the result 
when the user selects the option c) Search.
